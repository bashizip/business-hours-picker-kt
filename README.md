  ## How to use it 
  
   
First  Add the picker and the viewer you want to use in your layout files. The library has 4 main components,
2 Pickers and 2 viewer respectively :

**BusinessHoursPicker**

 Use it to pick a single business day
 


    <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursPicker
        app:dayOfWeek="Monday"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>

        
  **BusinessHoursWeekView**
  
  Use it to pick a full week of business days from monday to sunday

	   <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursWeekView
		android:id="@+id/bh_view"
		android:layout_width="match_parent"
	      android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>

   
   **BusinessHoursView**
    
   Use it to display a single business day
   
     <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHourView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>


**BusinessHoursWeekView**
     
   Use it to display a full week of business days 
   

    <com.bashizip.bhlib.BusinessHoursWeekView
        android:id="@+id/bh_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
  
     
  Then in your java code :
  
  **The picker activity of fragment**
  

	  BusinessHoursWeekPicker bh_picker = findViewById(R.id.bh_picker);
	  Button btn_apply = findViewById(R.id.btn_apply);
	     btn_apply.setOnClickListener(view -> {
		   List<BusinessHours> bhs = bh_picker.getBusinessHoursList();

		   // Here do your stuffs with the list

	   //In this example we pass it to another activity for viewing

	   Intent intent = new Intent(this, ViewerActivity.class);
		    intent.putExtra(BH_LIST, (Serializable) bhs);
		    startActivity(intent);

		});
 		
	
        
   **The viewer activity or fragment**
   
   
        List<BusinessHours> businessHoursList = getList();
       
       // Just call the setModel method and it's done !
       businessHoursWeekView.setModel(businessHoursList);
